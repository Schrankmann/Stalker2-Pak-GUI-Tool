S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 GUI Tool for Unpacking & Packing archives
----------------------------------------------------------

Since I initially found unpacking and packing archives with the repak tools a bit confusing, I decided to create a small helper tool to streamline the process and minimize common errors. A big thanks to StalkerBoss, whose tutorial helped me understand the repak tools properly.

You can also switch between English and German interfaces on the fly.

Functionality has been tested on both my desktop and laptop PCs.

Instructions: 
Follow StalkerBoss' Nexusmods Tutorialï»¿ on how to set up trumank's repak tools correctly. Since v1.1 my program does not need the additional .bat files that are used in the tutorial anymore. I still recommend checking out the Tutorial though.
Once you have the repak tools set up correctly, just place my PakGUI.exe file in the same location as the Repak.bat and ReUnpak.bat and launch it. 
Everything else is done through the GUI of my program.
Ideally place the .pak files you want to extract in the same location as the exe. I have tested it without moving them and it worked for me, but I would still advise you to relocate them first.
